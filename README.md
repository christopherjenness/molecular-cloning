## Status

I created this project because I wanted a cloning applicataion that could behave exactly how I wanted.  Unfortunately, I forgot that the major feature a clonning application should have is to be able to parse every file type imaginable (.dna, .gb, .gbk, .seq, .embl, .fa, ...).  Without this ability, cloning applications are useless.  This is going to take 95% of the time to develop this project, and sucks all the fun out of it.  I've decided to quit (an hour after making this repo).
